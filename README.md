# Quantum Circuit Simulation with Basis State and Double Excitation

This repository contains Python code for simulating quantum circuits using the PennyLane library. Specifically, the circuit initializes a Hartree-Fock (HF) basis state, applies a DoubleExcitation gate, and computes the resulting quantum state.
